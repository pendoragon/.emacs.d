;; Provide ido, which makes completing buffers and finding files much easier.
;; Note ido creates "ido.last" file under ~/.emacs.d directory.
;; http://www.emacswiki.org/cgi-bin/wiki/InteractivelyDoThings
;; Usage:
;;   C-j create file even if there is completion for the name. e.g. create file
;;       init.el when there is init-abc.el. Also used to open directory.
;;   C-l refresh directory content.
